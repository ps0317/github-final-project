How to contribute to Ruby on Rails
Did you find a bug?
Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Rails, and instead to refer to our security policy.

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and paste the content into the issue description:

Active Record (models, database) issues
Action Pack (controllers, routing) issues
Generic template for other issues
